# Ruby Script Overview

## Description
This Ruby script processes input data related to games, possibly scores or statistics. It reads input from the command line and applies logic to categorize and assign numerical values to different categories within each game.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Reading Input Data**
   ```ruby
   input = ARGF.read.lines
   ```
   - This line reads the data from the command line or redirected file input.

2. **Processing Games Data**
   ```ruby
   games = input.map.with_index do |line, i|
       # ... processing logic ...
   end
   ```
   - The script processes each line of input, extracting information about 'sets' and assigning them to individual games.

3. **Validating Data**
   ```ruby
   valid = true
   game[:sets].each do |set|
       set.each do |c, n|
           valid = false if (c == :r && n > 12) || (c == :g && n > 13)
           # ... more conditions ...
       end
   end
   ```
   - Applies specific conditions to validate the data (e.g., 'r' not exceeding 12, 'g' not exceeding 13).

## Usage Instructions
1. **Ruby Environment**: Ensure Ruby is installed on your system. You can download and install it from [Ruby's official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

2. **Input Data Preparation**: The script expects input in a specific format, either directly via the command line or redirected from a file.

3. **Running the Script**: In the terminal, navigate to the script's directory and run it using `ruby script.rb`. You can also redirect input from a file like so: `ruby script.rb < input.txt`.

4. **Interpreting Results**: The script outputs the processed data to the standard output. Understanding the context and format of the data is crucial for correct interpretation.

Note: This README provides an overview based on the initial part of the script. The script may contain further logic not covered in this summary.
