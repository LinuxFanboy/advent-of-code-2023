### Advent of Code DAY 3

#### Overview
This repository contains a Ruby script and its associated input data, designed to process and analyze structured data, possibly related to mechanical or engineering designs. The script interprets the input data, identifies numerical sequences, and performs specific operations on them.

#### Contents
1. `input`: A text file containing structured data in a grid-like format, comprising characters, numbers, and symbols.
2. `script.rb`: A Ruby script that processes the input file, identifies numerical sequences, and manipulates them according to defined rules.

#### How to Run
- Ensure Ruby is installed on your system.
- Place your structured data in the `input` file.
- Run the script using the command: `ruby script.rb < input`

#### Functionality
- **script.rb**: Reads the input data, adds padding around the lines for processing, and then scans for numerical sequences. It performs operations on these sequences, potentially for analyzing or interpreting mechanical or engineering designs.

#### Requirements
- Ruby

The project is open for modifications and extensions. For any queries or contributions, please open an issue or a pull request in the repository.
